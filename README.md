# Dungeons and Dragons 5e Spell Book

## Description

The "Dungeons and Dragons 5e Spell Book" is a small web application that allows users to explore a collection of magical spells from the popular tabletop role-playing game Dungeons & Dragons (D&D) 5th Edition. The project utilizes the D&D 5th Edition API as the source of spell data. The app provides a list of spells, the ability to view spell details, and a search filter to easily find specific spells.

## Features

- **Spell List:** The application presents users with a list of spells from the D&D 5th Edition API. Each spell is represented as a button, displaying the spell's name.

- **Spell Details:** When users click on a spell button, the app fetches additional details about the selected spell from the API. The spell's range, casting time, components, and description are displayed on the page.

- **Search Filter:** To enhance user experience, a search filter is integrated into the app. Users can enter the name of a spell they are looking for, and the app dynamically filters the spell list to show relevant results based on the input.
